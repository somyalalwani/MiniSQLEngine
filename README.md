# MiniSQLEngine

AIM : To develop a mini sql engine which will run a subset of SQL queries using command line interface
**Programming Language Used : Python3
Dataset:**

1. csv files for tables.
    a. If a file is : File1.csv , the table name would be File
    b. There will be no tab separation or space separation, so you are not required to handle it but you have to make sure to take care of both csv file type
       cases: the one where values are in double quotes and the one where values are without quotes.
2. All the elements in files would be only ​ **INTEGERS**
3. A file named: metadata.txt (note the extension) would be given to you which will have the following structure for each table:
       <begin_table>
       <table_name>
          <attribute1>
             ....
<attributeN>
<end_table>

**Type of Queries:** ​You’ll be presented with the following set of queries:
1. **Project** ​ Columns(could be any number of columns) from one or more tables :
```
a. Select * from table_name;
b. Select col1, col2 from table_name;
```
2. **Aggregate functions** ​: Simple aggregate functions on a single column. Sum, average, max, min and count. They will be very trivial given that the data is only integers:
```
       Select max(col1) from table_name;
```

3. Select/project with ​ **distinct** ​ from one table: (distinct of a pair of values indicates the pair should be distinct)
 ```
       Select distinct col1, col2 from table_name;
```
4. Select with ​ **WHERE** ​ from one or more tables :
```
   Select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where col1 = 10 AND col2 = 20;
```
a. In the where queries, there would be a maximum of one AND/OR operator with no NOT operators.
b. Relational operators handeled are : "< , >, <=, >=, =".

5. Select/Project Columns(could be any number of columns) from table using “​ **group by** ​”:
```
       Select col1, COUNT(col2) from table_name group by col1.
```
a. In the group by queries, Sum/Average/Max/Min/Count can be used as aggregate functions.
6. Select/Project Columns(could be any number of columns) from table in ascending/descending order according to a column using “​ **order by”** ​:
 ```
Select col1,col2 from table_name order by col1 ASC|DESC.
```
a. At max only one column can be used to sort the rows.

● For the above queries, please note all the permutations and combinations of SQL that MySQL permits, specially when it comes to multiple tables.

**Format of Input :**
Automated evaluation will be done, so include a bash script in your final submission to
run the queries. Command to execute a sql query and would be of the form:
2020201092.sh <“SQL Query”>

Here, the SQL Query would be a command line argument. Example :
“select col(s) from table_name where condition”


**Format of Output:**
<Table1.column1,Table1.column2,... TableN.columnM>
Row
Row
.......
RowN
